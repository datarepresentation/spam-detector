# spam-detector

Description

The huge part of machine learning tasks is related to text analyses. Text, as a source of information, has been used in such tasks as recommendation generation, behavior analyses, churn prediction, classification, etc. In this task, you will perform classification task – given real comments from YouTube videos, you should classify if it is spam or not.

Objective

The first step of this project is to analyze the dataset – compute, distribution of unique words, visualize them..., i.e. do exploratory data analysis. Explore text representation techniques - word2vec, tf-idf. In the below dataset, each sample consists of comment_id, author, date, content, tag. Based on the above analysis, design your machine learning algorithm to detect spam comments.

Upon completing this project, we expect: (i) a brief description of the literature; (ii) a working classification model; (iii) experimental evaluations with different approaches.
